### Episodiac - TV Episodes Rename Tool

Bring your TV Shows in order! For fun, because you can or for archiving proposes. If you use mediacenter software like Kodi,
it is mandatory to name files correctly so the mediacenter will be able to identify and import your episodes or whole series.

Episodiac does support the most common API, such as TMDb (www.themoviedb.org), TheTVDB (www.thetvdb.com),
TVmaze (www.tvmaze.com) and OMDb (www.omdbapi.com).

### How to use?
1. Choose one of the supported API and search for a series title.
2. Select a series name
3. Select the folder your episode(s) are located;
4. Try a preview and see if you are happy with the results ...
5. ... hit the rename button.

### Don't hit the red button!
You can experiment, change settings and preview for final results. As long as you won't hit the red button,
no changes will be made. Episodiac enables you to set the final filename as you like using {PLACEHOLDERS}.
You can use none of them or multiple times the same. You can also add custom text.

Eventually you have to hit the red button if you want to rename your files. No risk no fun!
